# Problem statement

With the rise in the variety of cars with differentiated capabilities and features such as model, production year, category, brand, fuel type, engine volume, mileage, cylinders, colour, airbags and many more, we are bringing a car price prediction challenge for all. We all aspire to own a car within budget with the best features available. To solve the price problem we have created a dataset of 19237 for the training dataset and 8245 for the test dataset.

# About Data

* Train.csv - 19237 rows x 18 columns (Includes Price Columns as Target)
* Attributes : ID, Price: price of the care(Target Column), Levy, Manufacturer,Model,Prod. year,Category,Leather interior,Fuel type,Engine volume,Mileage,Cylinders,Gear box type,Drive                   wheels,Doors,Wheel,ColorAirbags
* Test.csv - 8245 rows x 17 columns

# Tools/Techniques used:

* Python 
* Data Visualization using Seaborn/Matplotlib
* Data pre-processing/handing outliers
* Feature Engineering
* Cross validation
* Random forest
* Extra trees
* Light GBM
* Optimizing RMSLE
